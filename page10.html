            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">Narrator: On a hot sunny day, when Bulacan State University was acting like an oven set to 300˚C once again, Kimberly Chi, an exchange student from Korea, first stepped in the gates of her new academe. Being a Mass Communication student, her college building is located at the farther end of the whole campus when you start from gate 1, and as a person with no sense of direction whatsoever and has absolutely no luck on that day, Kim was outside gate 1. Sweat dripping down her startled face, Gaius saw it in her eyes, she has no sense of direction, and is completely and utterly lost.
<div><br></div><div>Gaius: Hi miss! I can see that you are new here?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *nods her head*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Do you know where you’re room is? If you are not running late, I am willing to tour you to the wonderful community of Bulacan State University.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Yes! Of course. Thank God. I still have a few minutes to spend.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Great! Let’s go. However, beware. As you pass through this gate, you would see many people from various cultures and sexual demographics, but do not fret. Most of them would just ignore you. Anyway, let’s go!
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: As Gaius and Kim paced inside the university, a typical issue of Bulsuans was evaded by the beauty of Kim Chi; she got inside even without her I.D.! Gaius was shook, of course. Then, they started walking around the campus while conversing.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: This building at our left, is the Alvarado Hall, building of the two-year courses. And, when you glance at your right, you would see the Activity Center where students are playing different kinds of ball games. You may or may not get hit by a ball on the head, or other body parts. Just be alert.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Why? Has it happened to you before?
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: *remembers the time he passed out due to a stray volleyball* Of course, not! I’m just concerned your safety.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *blushes*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Come on, let’s take a different route!
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: Gaius and Kim made a sharp right and found themselves in front of Rizal Park.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *laughs* Why does he looks like he is being tickled?
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: You see, no one really knows, but it is true.
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *laughs hysterically*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: If you want to get some fresh air or get really sunburnt, this is the place to be.
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: Both of them started to like each other; walls were collapsing, jokes were prevailing and emotions were getting more and more genuine. They continued walking and found themselves in front of the College of Nursing Building.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: This building comprises two colleges: College of Nursing for the lower stories, College of Information and Communications Technology for the upper.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Wow! Two in one.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Ooh! Do you wanna see a magic trick?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Ok?
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: You see this building? *points at the CON* You think that this is the end of this path, right?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *nods her head*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Well it’s not. *walked quickly to the corner of the AC and CON* It actually has another building hiding behind it!
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *grinned at the shoddy magic*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: This is CoEng. I don’t know why it was called CoEng, due to the fact that various colleges could use those rooms below, but all I know that… I don’t know much about this building, so let’s go! *laughs*
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: The two ran as if their lives were at stake. They arrived at the Nursing Canteen, and sat at one of the cafeteria tables there.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Do want a drink?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Water, please.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: *jokingly* I’ll just add this to the Touring Fee later.
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: As they’ve regained energy, they continued on their journey. As they were on their way to the College of Law, Kim noticed something strange.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: What’s that? *points at the tunnel*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Oh that? That’s one end of a portal to a new world?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: What?!
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *laughs out loud*
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: They started walking again.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: This is blindingly white building is the-
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: College of Law.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: How did you?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *points at the giant ‘College of Law’ sign.
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *smirked*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Anyway, when you’re walking here, be wary.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Why?
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Because you would encounter so many cars here! Try not to get ran over by one!
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: Kim and Gaius are noticing and liking each other’s sense of humor, and, once again, Kim asked another peculiar question.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: What’s that? *points at the giant dish rack statue*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: That’s actually a hot question here, but no one really knows what that is. It looks like a giant dish rack though. Bottom line, no one really cares! *laughs* Come on, let’s proceed.  
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: And, they went back to square one; in front of the Alvarado Hall.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Now, I have a question.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: What?
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: How many couple can you see in this lane?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: A lot! *laughs*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Hence, the Lover’s Lane.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *sarcastically* Wow! So amazing! Very informative!
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Okay, I’ll cut the useless info. *laughs*
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: The two continued trudging on the pavement until they reached the College of Home Economics building, so they turned left.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: On you left you will see the most feared building – CHE, the building of horrors. Never, ever use the washroom there, trust me.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Noted!
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Moving on, when you look straight ahead, you would see the Hostel. This is where you will be staying, right?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Yes, I’ve already been toured there.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Now, if you want to use the washroom, this is the place to be! Bidet for days, honey!
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *laughs*
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: Both of them pivoted and continued walking.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: The things that you will be seeing in your left are the new or soon to be additions to our university. First of, the soon to be 7-storey e-library. And, as you can see, our children might still witness its grand opening.
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *laughs*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Next is the Research and Technology Building. I personally don’t know anything about this, but the washrooms have bidets!! A contender to the Hostel’s washroom. And lastly, soon to be College of Business Administration building. It is noticeable that innovation is one trait BulSU focuses on.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *looks of disappointment*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: And I will also cut the cheesy marketing *smiles*
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Thank you!
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Well, let’s continue! The building on your right is the nest of pesky junior high school students, the Carpio Hall. The building is directly connected to the one beside it, our building, the Roxas Hall which, by the way, needs classroom innovation! *laughs* You see that narrow pathway there?  That’s the other end of the portal I’m telling you about!
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Ooh! So, that’s why it leads to a new world. *laughs*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: The more you know. So, let’s move on?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Leggo!
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: That entrance you see there is gate 2. The building you see on your right is the Natividad Hall, home of our finest Engineers. This building competes with the CHE building for being the most feared, especially during the issuance of cards.
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *laughs frantically*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Anyway, the big elephant in this location which, obviously, I’m not addressing is this, the Heroes’ Park where there are statues like Marcelo H. Del Pilar sitting on a throne, some dude is riding a horse, and heads of people who students do not know who they are and what their relevance are. Remember, save the best joke for last! *laughs*
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: The two then walked and walked and walked and walked until they reached the vanguard of Natividad Hall.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: On this road we’re standing on, you will encounter so many cars. Try not-
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: To get ran over by one, I know!
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *laughs*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: So, the building on you left is your college, the Federizo Hall. It is the oldest it has the most features, but we’ll talk about that later, after the campus tour. Anyway, the building on your left is a school supplies store, and a computer/printing store. If you ever forget to print a homework, you now know where to go.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Oh, you’ll see me often here, alright.
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *laughs*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Moving on, the Flores and Valencia Hall which also competes for the most feared building, especially during enrollment season. Trust me, you’ll hate it here.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Not excited to enroll *points at herself*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Come on, we’re near the end!
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: They both hurriedly walked on the roadside and found themselves at a cross road.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Are you tired?
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Actually, yes! *tiredly laughed* 
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Let’s just stand here and I’ll just word out the tour. On our left is the Mendoza Hall, home of the College of Social Science and Philosophy; home of the ‘sayk’ students. Walk straight and you’ll find gate 4. On our left is the COOP, a canteen, and the Chocolate building.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Why is it named like that?
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: It was actually chocolate colored once, thus, the name. Criminology and Legal Management students often use it. Walk straight and you’ll find gate 3. Were done! Now let’s go back to Federizo Hall.
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: The two lethargically walked back to the front of Federizo Hall.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: This is the main entrance of Fed. With some xerox shops and canteens in front of it, such as the famous honey tea, cantunan, and the paradoxical Potato Corner.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Is it because it’s in the middle, not on the corner?
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Exactly!
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *laughed genuinely*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius:  Let’s go to your building, milady!
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: As they were strolling through the oldest university building, Gaius was factually giving information to Kim.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: *while walking* This main staircase would directly lead you to the 2nd floor, on the side of the College of Science. Continuing our walk through corridors of the 2nd floor, will get us to the College of Arts and Letters which should start from Room 208, the first room from the border of the CS and CAL. Followed by the Room 209, which are both used for lectures and basic teachings, usually used by freshmen up to Juniors.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: This is where my 1st class will take place.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Try to familiarize yourself, so you will not be lost. *smiles*
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: I know! *overstatedly rolls eyes*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: *snickered* Moving on, the Dean’s office should be next, followed by the faculty room which is composed of all the English, Filipino and Mass Communication Instructors and other types of subjects related to language and literature.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: I’m sure that I don’t want to be there! *giggled*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: *while walking* This is the 2nd set of stairs, followed by the Library of the College which is filled with great books needed for learning the deep studies of literature and language. In this library you will find also the research papers in hard bind copies produced by the hard working students whom graduated and left their marks through their research papers.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: I could leave my mark too… through vandalizing the washroom. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *cackled*
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: *while walking* Then, the interesting rooms. First, the Computer Lab, wherein you will learn the basics and expert side of video and photo editing. Second, the Studio room where you’ll actually feel, in some way, the reality, at least, of being in a broadcasting studio. Then, the Speech Lab, a place where language and proficiency in speaking are broadened. And lastly-
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *jokingly* Thank God!
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: A small room composed of books and tables, rarely used by students. And that’s the end of the tour! P500, please!
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Oh, how cheap!
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *chuckled*
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: They went back to room 209, for Kim’s class would take place.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: It was so fun! I had a blast. I’m eternally grateful for you act of kindness. And, by the way, can I get your name?
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: *realizes that he never introduced himself, nor asked for the lady’s name* I’m Gaius
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: I’m Kim.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Nice to meet you *awkward silence*
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Anyways, need to get in, because it’s 10 minutes past my 1st class.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: Oh, okay go in now. You don’t want to be late for class.
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: *disappointed* All I want to say is that I would like to do this again 09082243268 times.
</div><div><br></div><div>Gaius: *shocked* Even maybe 09227932354 times.
</div><div><br></div><div>Both: *grinned*
</div><div><br></div><div>Kim: Bye, talk soon!
</div><div><br></div><div>Narrator: Kim entered the room and was immediately interrogated by a terror prof.
