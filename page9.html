</strong></div><div><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This phenomenological study evaluated the impact of strand shaming to the student’s strand inclination which affects their decision-making.  The study included ten (10) informants, provided there are atleast three representatives from each strand who were chosen through a purposive sampling method. The researcher used three main interview questions to guide the data collection. The questions were designed to help determine the influences of strand shaming on students’ strand preference. The study’s findings revealed that strand shaming played a role in senior high school students’ strand decision-making. This paper seeks to offer an in-depth awareness of the strand shaming’s emotional effects on students that swated their personal choice of strands.

</div><div><br></div><div><strong>INTRODUCTION
</strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;K-12 Program under Republic Act (R.A.) 10533 was approved and signed by the former President Benigno S. Aquino III, on May 15, 2013. This curriculum provides two (2) additional years in High School, commonly known as the Senior High School Program. As stated by Caballero (2015), this is believed to be one of the answers in th country’s issue on education system, the program offers two (2) tracks depending on the preference of the students.
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, due to the subject differences of each strand, a discrimination rose up between strands that has a specialized subject of Mathematics and Science than those with none (Fradiquela, 2018). This is commonly known as strand shaming (hereinafter referred to as “the phenomenon”). For three (3 years) of SHS being implemented, it still played a crucial moment for the students to decide which one to pursue.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bulacan State University is a university in the City of Malolos, Province of Bulacan which offers not only a Laboratory High School but also the newly enforced Senior High School Program. The academe is one of the well-known and well-respected schools in Bulacan, and is where the researchers are currently studying. 
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The academic track is for high school students who want to move in college. It will prepare you from college courses. Under this track are three strands; the Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMMS) Strand can lead a student to pursue courses related to Philosophy, English, Linguistics, Literature, Filipino and Islamic, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Strand, which is more focused on science, technology and math subjects, gives one lot of options on what to pick for one’s college course, and lastly, the Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM) Strand concentrates on the foundational concepts in corporate operations, financial management, business management, as well as each and every factor that revolves around those central fields.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Observing the current millennia of students under the K-12 Program, choosing a particular strand is a common problem brought about by “strand-shaming”. Based on a study conducted regarding the strand choice and career preference of Senior High School students, it is concluded that a vast number of students are affected by this particular phenomena (Ezeonu, 2016). Nowadays, strands are being made basis of a student’s capability of learning and is being used as criteria for judging intellectual capacity. With this, students are choosing a strand in favor of societal viewpoints, instead of having an independent stand based on what they really prefer and excel at. Strand shaming also limits the youth in developing individually, being forced to take mold on what is deemed by the majority as right and generally acceptable. These statements lead to the idea of individuality, that each and every student possesses a definite characteristic, and boxed way of thinking of society discourages the youth in progressing as themselves.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The researchers’ aim in this paper is to determine if strand shaming has an immense impact in students with regards to their selection of academic tracks in the K-12 Senior High School Program in Bulacan State University Laboratory High School. To determine the consequences of strand shaming the researchers will collect data by conducting interviews towards the participants.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study is mainly for the general understanding of the problems experienced by the students in different academic strands in Senior High School. The students and faculty of the school should be aware if said strand shaming is widespread in the campus and if it carries an adverse effect, then an administrative intervention may be recommended.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The overall objective of this phenomenological study is to determine the possible effects of strand shaming on the strand preference of Grade 11 students of Bulacan State University Laboratory High School. At this stage in the research, the phenomenon will be generally defined as the circumstance where the society criticizes and degrades students based on what strand they are from.
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically, the study will answer the following questions:&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; •	Question 1 (RQ1): How does strand shaming affects the students’ strand preference?
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o	Supporting Research Question 1 (SRQ1): How do Grade 11 students define strand </div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shaming?
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o	Supporting Research Question 2 (SRQ2): How does strand shaming affect the </div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; student’s preference of a strand?
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o	Supporting Research Question 3 (SRQ3): What factors lead to strand shaming?&nbsp;</span><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	3.1.) Student Related
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	3.2.) Peer
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	3.3.) Teacher-Related
</div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW
</strong></div><div><strong>Strand Shaming 
</strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Panoncio (2018) claimed in his article that strand shaming is a series of trash talking between Senior High School students who have chosen strands with “hardcore” Math and Science subjects against those who did not. More specifically, the “comparatively weaker” HUMSS. This battle of strands causes huge gaps, and divides the Senior High School students.
</div><div>In addition to this, Paleza (2018) stated that the issue regarding the diverseness of academic strand and subject difference in senior high school brings up a stigma which many students receive after choosing their upper secondary education track. This causes pressure that leads to poor academic performance and low self-esteem.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, the said matter results to discrimination which should not happen for each strand that deals with different levels of difficulty. The classified “weaker” strands should not be degraded by those other strands.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Howard Gardner (1983) proposed the Theory of Multiple Intelligences which states that there are various of forms intelligence may partake. Logical-mathematical, linguistic, musical, social, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, and personal intelligences are aspects that are inclined with different strands. Namely, STEM, ABM and HUMSS. Lastly, Fadriquela (2018) implies that every student has their own intelligence though conducted into different strands. The classification of strands is made to specialize the skills and capabilities of students, thus the wish to excel in their selected field.  
</div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Decision-Making
</strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Super (1990), with regards to his Self-Concept Theory of Career Development, states that the senior high school students are at the career development’s exploration stage. In this stage, people specify their vocational choices. Due to the fact that students do not have a definite career choice, they are still easily influenced by several factors such as strand shaming. In connection to this, the study of La (2009) unveiled that parental supports, school structure, gender and grade point average have affected the Vietnamese Senior high school students’ educational and career choice. Moreover, Leonard’s (2009) study on the students of South Carolina, regarding their course selection, found out that parents and teachers are influential in the course selection decision.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based from the Social Learning Theory by Bandura (1997), people learn by watching what other what other people or ‘role models’ do. By simply observing another ‘model’, a student’s action could be affected by another student’s action; a student’s preference could be affected by another student’s choice. Thus, if the ‘model’ joins the bandwagon of strand shaming and discrimination, the observer’s decision would be influenced.  In addition, Skinner (1953) states in his Operant Conditioning theory that people behave or do (refrain from doing) things because of rewards and punishments. Therefore, some students could have been forced to take the career they planned because of fear (negative stimulant).
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Influences on Decision-Making
</strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alika (2012) stated that parental and peer influence are certain factors which are involved in decision-making of adolescents.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As stated by Taylor and Harris (2014), parents and guardians play a significant role in their children's occupational aspirations and career goal development. Thus, a parent may urge a child to have a vocation similar to their own, or one that has demonstrated high earning power. For instance, a strand which is inclined to a profitable job will certainly be the choice of the parents.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, Cabrera &amp; Nasa (2000) said parental encouragement and support is a factor that influences the search and selection stages of the college choice process when savings for college affect the predisposition in deciding a course.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peer influence is considered a factor since in adolescent stage teenagers seek a group where he/she is socially accepted. Referring to peers’ choices affects the informant’s decision. In addition, Ambong (2017) said that interest of individuals has an impact by peers in fulfilling dreams or a certain career on account of being with them. 
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also, Wentzel (1991) observed that associating with friends who serve as academic and social resources could have a direct influence on school achievement outcomes. 
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Emotional Effects of Discrimination
</strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Discrimination and prejudice in the society has been existing for a long time, hugely affected by certain factors brought about by blind-eyed social norms and different self-centered perspectives, which in turn pushes the said phenomena, strand shaming, to occur. Social discrimination towards students in the academe created a negative impact not only on the victims who are experiencing it, but also the people around them.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Academic institutions has been a stepping stone and a mold for the young minds of the youth in partaking knowledge and strengthening their emotional and mental capabilities. The academe is designated to guide the youth in discovering their inner talents and skills. But in universities and schools where children are supposed to be encouraged and uplifted, discrimination and bullying are one of the daily challenges a student has to experience and overcome (Bennett, 2016). &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The judgmental eyes of the society are one of the causes of the said phenomena to occur. According to Nadine (2014), social discrimination in schools impacts student’s ability to succeed academically. Nadine found that this prejudice induces shyness and anxiousness, planting on student’s minds the feeling of being belittled and judged. This type of bullying also created a hierarchy, a barrier between the deemed intellectuals and those seen as academically challenged. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As said by Ross (2002), not every individual that has suffered from social bullying has overcome the trauma and escape from the thought and feeling of being discriminated. It happens most commonly in schools despite the fact that most individuals that can help them cope up with the phenomena are present there. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This research is a result of the emerging situation of some senior high students being degraded and treated as outcasts due to their chosen strands (Ross, 2002). Cited in Ross’ research that 15 % to 20% of the students experience bullying during their school years and 10-20% of that are often enough to consider as serious problems (2002). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div>
</div><div><strong>RESEARCH METHOD
</strong></div><div><strong>Qualitative
</strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The qualitative research method was used in the study because it is intact with rich detailed data that can speak through the informants’ perspectives and lead to multiple contexts in line with the under study phenomenon (Anderson, 2009). 
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to Merriam (2009), qualitative can generate a more realistic view of the world and of the phenomenon which cannot be obtained in numerical data and statistics. It involves the interest in human behavior with respect to the inter-action of these people to one another in a definite environment for example the school, workplace, auction (Heath et al,2010).
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover, Crossman (2019) said a qualitative research is a type of research which gathers and interprets non-numerical data. It aims to explain the significance of the data and helps understand social life from the study of a focused populace. In addition, a qualitative research emphasizes the micro-level of interaction in a typical day basis in terms of sociology, while quantitative research subject to the macro-level of phenomena.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Phenomenology
</strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Phenomenological approach will be used to help the participants determine whether strand shaming affected their decision making process in choosing their strand. According to Shosha (2012), phenomenology aims to provide an in-depth comprehension of the meaning of people's lived experiences and use the understanding of phenomena experienced by people themselves. The fundamental goal of this approach is to arrive at a description of the nature of the particular phenomenon, strand shaming, and how it affected one’s perception.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also, Creswell (2013) stated that through phenomenology, comparative meaning of a phenomenon could be gained from multiple individuals’ lived experiences. The data would determine comparisons and contrasts of each informants’ perspective of the phenomenon, which would verify the researchers’ study. Furthermore, this type of qualitative research is appropriate in determining the effects of a contemporary phenomenon to students, because according to The Phenomenology and Science of Emotions: An Introduction of Elpidorou (2014), “emotions reveal the basic structures of human experiences”.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically, the researchers applied the logical transcendental phenomenology in collecting the data. Moustakas (1994) offered systematic procedures for using transcendental phenomenology, which engaged rookie researchers (Thompson, 2018). He remarked the difficulty and necessity of the process in order that the phenomenon could be seen in a different point of view. The process is systematic throughout, but the mind sometimes drifts. Hence, each thought set aside must be recalled again through acknowledgement, followed by the intended act (Moustakas, 1994)
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moustakas (1994) stated that transcendental phenomenology is a “a scientific study of the appearance of things, of phenomena just as we see them and as they appear to us in consciousness”. Thompson (2018) claimed that transcendental phenomenology was applicable for a research for it removed the emphasis off the researchers, and giving it to the contemplation of the informants. The researcher’ perspectives were dismissed by concentrating on the participants’ experiences and standpoints.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Participants</strong>
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The population of interest are specific Grade 11 students from the Senior High School program of Bulacan State University Laboratory High School who experienced strand shaming. The study is aimed to gather pieces of information regarding how the issue ‘strand shaming’ affects their decision upon choosing the strand to pursue. The population was selected for the research because they are the ones who face strand-decision making and who experienced whether they have chosen the appropriate track or not. Given the population was only limited to Grade 11 students, it was a suitable group for the research topic. 
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the Senior High School coordinator, at the time of the study, the Senior High School program in Bulacan State University had 248 Grade 11 students from three strands offered in the university. Of the 248 Grade 11 students, 46 students come from HUMSS, 55 students in ABM, and 147 students for STEM. The participants in the study were obtained from each strand, making a total of ten participants gathered from the whole population. This classification ensured that all participants had knowledge in the phenomenon to give a valid account of their educational experience. 
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The number of participants in the study belong to the recommended range given by the mentor in charge in the research subject. According to Englander (2012), the researcher must be certain that the participants are capable to answer the research questions based on their experience. As stated by Marshall et al. (2013) sample sizes are not justified in qualitative research. In addition, Creswell (2013) states that 5-25 participants are the typical approach for qualitative studies. Moreover, Mason (2010) specified that the common samples used are multiples of ten.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to the interview conducted, the participants were provided consent forms that 
</div><div>elaborate the purpose of the study and is required to be signed. The study used interviews for the gathering of data. The interview questions satisfy the research question of the study attributal to the logical and structured manner. All the data gathered by the researchers were through face-to-face or conversational interviews. The data were later to be transcribed.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The participants responded open-ended, communicative questions regarding strand shaming and decision-making and the influences of decision making that is experienced by the students. The researchers checked the structure and the appropriateness of the words for the interview questions. The interview questions were developed with the intent to acquire in-depth information to satisfy and answer the major research question and the supporting questions. The exact data collection procedure consisted of
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•	Obtaining approval to conduct the study;
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•	Providing all consent forms to potential participants;
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•	Scheduling face-to-face conversational interviews;
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•	Conducting interviews;
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•	Transcribing interviews; and
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•	Analyzing data collected.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The researchers expected the interview questions to be answered in a reasonable period of time. The agreed amount of time for each interview was five to ten minutes. The amount of time set is sufficient, for it would guarantee the researcher and participant a relaxed and unhurried interview to obtain the necessary information. In conclusion, the researchers also took notes to apprehend the body language and voice modulation of each participant on the contrary to recording all the data in the interview.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Interview Questions
</strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study conducted involved a total of 10 participants, wherein there are at least three representing students per strand. Each interviewee was asked three main questions in order to extract information, with each main question followed by supporting queries to further deepen the discussion. The interview began with a preliminary talk which includes a description of the study conducted, as well as a preview of the aforementioned phenomena, strand-shaming. This approach hopefully aims to connect with the participant better and for them to sincerely answer each of the questions with their own personal experiences. The following questions were asked to guide the interview:
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Major Question 1

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><strong>RESULTS
</strong><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eight females and two males participated in the study. The study participants had varying strands and had experienced strand shaming. The researchers asked each participant two questions about his or her demographics before beginning the interview questions. One demographic question collected information relevant to the criteria established to be part of the study. Because a strand could determine and differentiate one’s strand shaming experience and thus prove the seriousness of strand shaming, this demographic information was important to the study. The demographic information included gender of participant, and strand of participant. Table 4.1 shows the information collected from the demographic questions.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gender of participants was important to show inclusiveness of the study. Having both male and female participants provided validity to the study through diversity. The distribution of participants by gender was eight (80%) female and two (20%) were male.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Emerging Themes
</strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The researcher used three main interview question to guide the data collection process. Each main question was supported by proving questions to help the participants tell their stories. The questions were designed to help determine whether strand shaming affected the participant’s decision in strand choice. The interview questioning generated three themes.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Theme 1: Strand Shaming Familiarity
</strong></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As indicated in Table 4.2, three responses and 70 references supported the theme that shows the familiarity of senior high students to strand shaming. Participant 1 explained,
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Para sakin, yung hindi pantay-pantay na tingin sa iba’t-ibang strand natin tapos, just <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;because hindi s’ya pantay-pantay although iba-iba yung abilities na naiko-contribute ng <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mga students per strand, the means of hindi pagpantay-pantay, yung iba dine-degrade <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yung iba naman masyadong mas pinapahalagahan kesa dun sa iba.
</em></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When talking about how they feel about other strand shaming victims, Participant 9 empathized wholeheartedly to any instance he sees a victim of strand shaming. He expressed&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">his frustrations:&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kasi malulungkot, parang hindi pa lahat naiintindihan na mayroon tayong different <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;strengths. So bale pagka nakakakita ka ng strand shaming na parang tinatanggal mo yung <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;gusto nila sa sarili ni eh. Yung gusto nilang gawin, parang nililimit mo sakanila. Kumbaga <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;parang nililigaw mo sila, na parang inaalis mo yung passion nilayung ember nila sa puso nila, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;na tinatanggal mo yun.&nbsp;</em></span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Participant 10 shared his feelings of being stereotyped. He recalled, “Strand shaming affected my strand choice kasi sa pananaw ng magulang ko syempre. Kase sinabi nga daw na mas madami kang matututunan sa STEM pero hindi nila naisip na mas specific kada strand.” Participant 4 recalled that, in spite of his dedication to the strand GAS, his choice was influenced by his aunt who thinks that STEM is the “superior strand”. He expressed his feelings of choosing a strand that he does not personally prefer. He said,
</div><div><br></div><div><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nag-state kasi yung tita ko ng isang fallacious statement; teacher kasi s’ya ng SHS so </em></div><div><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yung mga na-handle n’yang mga strand bukod sa STEM actually had serious attitude <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;problems tapos sasamahan mo pa ng katamaran at below average academic performance <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;kaya sinabi n’ya sa akin na mag-STEM ako kasi mga bobo raw yung mga na-handle n’ya <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dahil na rin siguro sa inis n’ya na they don’t value education seriously. Pero generalization <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lang yun ng tita ko, still in a way, naka-affect parin s’ya sa akin. Gusto ko talaga mag-GAS <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;noon and I was on the verge of tranferring pero dahil nga rin sa ayaw nila at yung process <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ng paglipat ng school di na ko nag-GAS. Semi-strand shamed kumbaga.

A total of 100% of the sample participants claimed that they are aware of how strand shaming come across senior high school students. Ninety-percent of the participants have shared experiences on becoming a victim of it and with the same percentage (90%) admitted to show empathy on people that has been discriminated because of their strand.
</p><p><strong>Theme 2: Emotional Effects of Strand Shaming
</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As indicated in the table 4.3 three invariant constituents and 67 references supported the theme that is concerned with the emotional effects of strand shaming on senior high school students. Participant 7 claimed that “there is no strand more prestigious than the other because strands are made for the specialization of students”. She added,
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wala namang ganong strand shaming pero pagdating sa STEM na strand ay tingin nila <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mas inferior ang ABM.</em></span><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In contrast with that, Participant 9 convey that she had a background experience on being strand shamed and concluded,
</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be honest I felt that our credibility when it comes to academic performances are being <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;downed by almost the administration or those who are around us or who sees that <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mathematics is better than History or English. When in fact every subject is equal and it <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;must not define what a person can do academically and professionally.
</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Participant 1 recalled some instances that they cannot escape some people’s putting them down because of their strand (HUMSS) and stated that,
</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Depende sa sitwasyon, sa iba sinsabi na siguro magaling ka magsulat o hindi ka magaling <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sa Math usually pag may sinabi kang strand sinasabi iniisip na nila na dito meron syang <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;strength dito meron s’yang weakness depende naman sa strand.
</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Participant 4 shared the stories he heard and placed himself in the victims’ perspective. He said:
</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Actually, I’ve heard stories from my friends na na-strand shamed. Put yourself in their <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shoes. Ano mararamdaman mo pagka na-judge ka for just doing your passion and the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;things that you love. Which would be tragic that people will degrede others just for some <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;concepts that the aspiring engineers or doctors are superior compared to our future lawyers <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and journalists.
</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Participant 8 believed that her strand is “prestigious in its own way” and explained,
</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every strand has its own uniqueness, so it means din na every strand may mga strength <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;so dapat tigilan na yung pangsheshame ng strand kasi lahat may pagkakaiba iba.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ten participants (100% of the sample) claimed that they had experience on various people’s perception depending the strand that they have chosen. Some (90%) of the participants encountered toughness on being strand shamed but nonetheless, all the participants had a background knowledge upon the emotional effects of the phenomena that affected their personal feelings. Overall, the entire group of participants are proud enough of their chosen strand. 
<div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Theme 3: Decisiveness on Strand Choice
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As indicated in Table 4.4, three invariant constituents and 30 references supported the theme regarding the level of decisiveness of the senior high school students with respect to their strands. Participant 3, 4, and 10 concede that strand shaming affected their choice of strand while the rest stand firm with their choices are not affected by strand shaming. Relatively, Participant 10 stated that his personal choice of strand is ABM but took STEM because,
</div><div>
</div><div><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sinabe ng mama ko na mag-pilot na lang ako or mag-STEM kase mas collective daw dun <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yung lesson na maita-tackle sa college.
</em></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Participant 4 explained how his choice of strand was change because of the influence of strand shaming not just in the form of other people’s comments but is also experienced within yourself (intrapersonal) and stated,
</div><div>
</div><div><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Superior kasi, feeling ko may part sakin talaga na feeling ko superior tayo [mga STEM] <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hindi naman sa nangsa-strand shame ako pero, kasi mayroon tayong diference ng subject <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;na kahit hindi naman sa pagiging ignorante kasi mayroon talagang mas mahirap yung <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;subjects natin.
</em></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, Participant 8 believed that strand shaming does not affected her strand choice because she knew that her strand will shine on its own and she is confident that she can make it shine like other strands and added,
</div><div>
</div><div><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I won’t change my strand. I know that I’m worthy to be called as a HUMSS student and I <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;can defend my strand and myself to those who strand shame.
</em></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Participant 1 said that they [HUMSS Students] only experience being looked up when it comes to writing and nothing else but does not define her strand choice because she said,
</div><div>
</div><div><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wala naman para sakin kase iba’t-iba naman yung abilities natin as a person kapag <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pinaapekto pa natin o nilagay natin sa mga mindset natin na strand shaming should exist <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pinapalaganap pa natin yung thought na yun, soonover baka magkaron pa ng mindset na <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dapat magkaron pa ng levels pagdating sa strand, di ko sya tinotorelate.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The majority (8; 80%) of the participants proudly claimed that their strand choice is purely by their own decision while the remaining 20% confessed that they considered the effects of strand shaming upon choosing what strand. Seventy percent of the participants stayed firm that they won’t change strands even if given an opportunity while Participant 10 stated that he would have chosen ABM because he still wants to pursue Accountancy and Law. 
</p><p><strong>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
<br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study of the strand shaming’s influence to the decision-making of students was a substantial factor to their conclusive and preferred choices, and thus proved a definite deal of students were significantly affected by the phenomena. Though there are limited researches to sustain the details and purpose of the study, numerous articles interfaced about strand shaming and disclose facts that it is an extensive factor towards students.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the response of one participant, strand shaming is the biased and unbalanced treatment of people to the students regardless of the uniqueness of capabilities. This is the negligent treatment to what a student can contribute by means of degrading the potential credibility of the students in pursuing their specialization. Ninety percent of them imparted relative experience and background knowledge about being strand shamed.
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The results of the study revealed that strand shaming did affect 30% of participants’ population in choosing their choice of strand. The findings also proved that strand shaming is a serious phenomenon emotionally affecting Senior High School students, by means of the majority’s connotation to specific strands. The negative opinions expressed by people surrounding the participants caused negative feelings and became a factor leading to strand shaming. Hence, the whole participant-population remained proud and dignified with their chosen strands.
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Strand shaming affected the decision making of students influencing them to be indecisive towards their strand-preference. The phenomena created an impact on student’s mindset giving them a doubtful thought in transferring to a more superior strand in order to feel equal. One out of the three participants who experienced sticked to her personal preference while the other two were immensely affected by the said strand shaming therefore, they changed strands. Moreover, seventy percent of the population stand firm to their strand choice.
</p><p><strong>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">IMPLICATIONS&nbsp;<br></span></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>It has been 3 years since the Senior High School program was established, and its benefits are still in test. Despite efforts on the part of administrators to provide globally competitive curriculums and innovative learning experiences, the growing discrimination amongst strands continue to be of concern. Evidence collected from related literatures suggests that the challenge faced by the senior high school students, particularly HUMSS, are well-expressed, but not enough to provide a concrete basis, and thus, be taken not seriously.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Philippines has the highest rate of economic and social inequality in Southeast Asia. This problem is not limited to personal wealth. Land distribution, basic welfare programs, educational and vocational opportunities are also affected by it (ASEAN Trade Union Council, 2011). This is the first study to explore the role of strand racism and influence in senior high students’ strand preference and choice. The research method allowed the participants of the study to provide understanding through their experiences, i.e., the strand discrimination and maltreatment experienced before, during and after choosing their strand of choice. The findings of the study complemented the vast number of existing literature supporting the concept of strand discrimination.
</p><p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Reproducing the study with a larger sample of participants from varying universities could provide an opportunity for the generalization of the study findings. The results act as major resources which helps students understand the seriousness of strand shaming and avoid committing it. The participants’ stories all implied that the current resources can significantly affect the authenticity of their strand choice. A future study involving several students from all parts of the Philippines would determine if strand shaming is a bigger problem based on the researchers’ region.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>REFERRENCES
